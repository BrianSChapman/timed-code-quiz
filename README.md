## Description

Taking the preexisting knowledge I already have of Javascript, I was tasked with utilizing new tools in the Document Object Model to build a coding quiz - time attack style. It needed to have a running clock, penalties for wrong answers, and the ability to enter a high score board upon completion.


## Usage

When the screen loads, hit the "Start" button and work your way through the questions testing your grilled cheese knowledge. If you miss one, time gets deducted from your final score. Whatever time you have left will equal points toward the High Score Board.
